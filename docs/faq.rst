FAQ & Known issues
==================

Tangram needs lots of external dependencies to run properly, and having them run on UCSF Chimera can be tricky if not done properly. To do that, we have built ``pychimera``, on which Tangram is built. Before `raising an issue <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram/issues>`_, please have a look at the `known issues <https://pychimera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ in its documentation.
