It's composed of several independent graphical interfaces and commands for UCSF Chimera. Each extension or *tan* has its own separate repository, as detailed in the list below. The project name is (almost) always prefixed with *tangram_* for easy identification.

As installing extensions in UCSF Chimera can be tricky, specially if external dependencies are required, in this repository we provide `Linux and MacOS installers <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram/releases>`_ to handle that for you. More details are provided below. The documentation will be collected here, as well.

Tangram extensions
----------------

After the installation, a new menu will be available under *Tools*, called *InsiliChem*.

- **Calculation setup**

    - `MMSetup <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_openmmgui>`_: Setup MD calculations with OpenMM and ommprotocol [WIP]

    - `QMSetup <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_qmsetup>`_: QM and QM/MM calculations setup

- **Visualization**

    - `3D-SNFG <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_snfg>`_: Enable easy visualization of saccharydic residues

    - `BondOrder <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_bondorder>`_: Automatic bond order perception for UCSF Chimera [WIP]

    - `GAUDIView <https://github.com/insilichem/gaudiview>`_: Lighweight visualization of results coming from docking, conformational search or multiobjective optimization

- **Analysis**

    - `NCIPlotGUI <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_nciplot>`_: Straightforward interface to setup calculations for NCIPlot and visualize them

    - `NormalModes <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_normalmodes>`_: Perform Normal Modes Analysis and view them directly on-screen

    - `PLIPGUI <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_plipgui>`_: Depict protein-ligand interactions, as calculated with PLIP

    - `PoPMuSiCGUI <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_popmusicgui>`_: Depict and apply the predictions made by PoPMuSiC calculations

    - `PropKaGUI <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_propkagui>`_: Analyze and depict the expected pKa values of protein residues with PropKa 3.1

    - `SubAlign <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_subalign>`_: Align two, potentially different, molecules based on partial matches of substructures

- **Utilities & Patches**

    - `DummyMetal <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_metalgeom>`_: A subtle modification to UCSF Chimera's MetalGeom extension to allow arbitrary elements to be placed at vacant positions, instead of just oxygens

    - `OrbiTraj <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_orbitraj>`_: A subtle modification to UCSF Chimera's MD Movie extension to allow the visualization of volumetric data along a molecular trajectory

    - `ReVina <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram_vinarelaunch>`_: Resubmit failed AutoDock Vina jobs without reconfiguring the GUI


Installation and usage
----------------------

Check the `docs <http://tangram-suite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_!

Help and support
----------------

Feel free to `submit an issue in this repository <https://github.com/insilichem/tangram/issues>`_ if you have any problems with the installation process. However, if the issue is extension-specific, please use the Issues section of the corresponding repository (links are provided in the list above)
